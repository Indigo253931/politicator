					<h2>Hilary Clinton</h2>		
						<div class="animals_envrionment">
							<h3>Animal and Envrionmental Protection</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The way our society treats animals is a reflection of our humanity.</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="climate_change">
							<h3>Climate Change</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I won’t let anyone take us backward, deny our economy the benefits of harnessing a clean energy future, or force our children to endure the catastrophe that would result from unchecked climate change.</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="healthcare">
							<h3>Healthcare</h3>
								<ul>									
									<li>The Affordable Care Act made preventive care available and affordable for an estimated 39 million people with Medicare and saved more than 9 million people with Medicare thousands of dollars in prescription drug expenses</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>	
						<div class="military">
							<h3>Military</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I believe in strong alliances; clarity in dealing with our rivals; and a rock-solid commitment to the values that have always made America great. </li>
								</ul> 
							</div>
						<div class="gun_control">
							<h3>Gun Control</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I believe weapons of war have no place on our streets. We may have our disagreements on gun safety regulations, but we should all be able to agree on a few things. If the FBI is watching you for suspected terrorist links, you shouldn’t be able to just go buy a gun with no questions asked. You shouldn’t be able to exploit loopholes and evade criminal background checks by buying online or at a gun show. And yes, if you’re too dangerous to get on a plane, you are too dangerous to buy a gun in America.</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="abortion">
							<h3>Abortion</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Politicians have no business interfering with women's personal health decisions. I will oppose efforts to roll back women's access to reproductive health care, including Republican efforts to defund Planned Parenthood. As president, I'll stand up for Planned Parenthood and women’s access to critical health services, including safe, legal abortion.</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="college">
							<h3>College</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Let’s … make debt-free college available to everyone. ... And let’s liberate the millions of Americans who already have student debt.</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="immigration">
							<h3>Immigration</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>If we claim we are for family, then we have to pull together and resolve the outstanding issues around our broken immigration system. The American people support comprehensive immigration reform not just because it’s the right thing to do—and it is—but because they know it strengthens families, strengthens our economy, and strengthens our country. … We can’t wait any longer for a path to full and equal citizenship. (May 5, 2015)</li>
								</ul> 
						<div class="trade">
								<h3>Trade</h3>
									<ul>
										<li>I have a very clear view. We have to trade with the rest of the world. We are 5 percent of the world's population. We have to trade with the other 95 percent. And trade has to be reciprocal. That's the way the global economy works. But we have failed to provide the basic safety net support that American workers need in order to be able to compete and win in the global economy.</li>
									</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="LGBTQ">
							<h3>LGBTQ</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Hillary will work with Congress to pass the Equality Act, continue President Obama’s LGBT equality executive actions, and support efforts underway in the courts to protect people from discrimination on the basis of gender identity and sexual orientation in every aspect of public life.</li>
								</ul> 
						</div>
						<div class="marriage">
							<h3>Gay marriage</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>I'll fight to ensure lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender Americans have full equality under the law, and to end discrimination in employment, housing, schools, and other aspects of our society.</li>
								</ul>

									<li>The Second Amendment guarantees a fundamental right that belongs to all law-abiding Americans.

						<h3>Greenhouse Gases</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Animal agriculture is responsible for <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.HTM" target="blank">18% of greenhouse gas emissions</a>, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation.
								</li>
								<li>Transportation exhaust is responsible for 13% of all greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gas emissions from this sector primarily involve fossil fuels burned for road, rail, air, and marine transportation.
								</li>
								<li>Livestock and their byproducts account for at least <a href="http://www.animalfeedscience.com/article/S0377-8401(11)00517-7/abstract" target="blank">32,000 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2)</a> per year, or 51% of all worldwide greenhouse gas emissions.
								</li>
								<li>Livestock is responsible for <a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm" target="blank">65% of all human-related emissions of nitrous oxide</a> – a greenhouse gas with 296 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide, and which stays in the atmosphere for 150 years.

							<h3>Methane</h3>
							<ul>
								<li>Methane is<a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/326/5953/716.figures-only" target="blank"> 25-100 times more destructive than CO2</a> on a 20 year time frame.

								</li>
								<li>US Methane emissions from livestock and natural gas are <a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/overview-greenhouse-gases#methane" target="blank">nearly equal.</a> 
								</li>
								<li>Cows produce <a href="http://www.ibtimes.com/cow-farts-have-larger-greenhouse-gas-impact-previously-thought-methane-pushes-climate-change-1487502" target="blank">150 billion gallons</a> of methane per day.
